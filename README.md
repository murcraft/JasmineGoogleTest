<h2>First test in Java Script with Jasmine.</h2>

<p>All tests are placed in <b>spec/</b> folder.</p>
<p>In order to run the tests, you will need to download at least the ChromeDriver and put it into your path.
I have included a <b>chromedriver</b> folder in this repo, that you can cut and paste into <b>node_modules</b> folder.</p>
<p>After this, use command:</p>
<ul>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm test spec\<i>filepath.js<i></li>
</ul>
